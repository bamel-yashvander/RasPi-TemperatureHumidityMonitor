# RasPi-TemperatureHumidityMonitor

This is a simple project using Raspberry pi which uses the following components:
    1. Raspberry pi
    2. DHT-11 Temperature Humidity Sensor

I have connected 3 DHT-11 sensors simultaneously on pins 4, 13 and 16 respectively and have also provided a usecase of how to initialize the class object and execute all the three simultaneously.

This could be used as a homemade fire-alarm and can also be mapped with sprinklers and many more applications.

# NOTE: This is just a template and does not do any actions, as of now, if the limits set are crossed. But it certainly can perform any specified operation by adding a desired method to the class.
